# Android-application
An application created on Android Studio.

the build has been updated, the UI has been changed from the previous build, gave some touchups and it works perfectly fine, some changes have been made, the app has been changed from the way it was, some tweaks have been added, and you get 2 options, red and yellow, yellow is for non-severe situations and red is for emergencies, if pressed red, it will ask for the desired contact details and then send the messages. yellow will send the details of your locations and will show details to the desired contact. I removed the feature of nearby hospitals and police stations to optimize the usage and to make it minimal. removed several sections from the previous versions, changed the toggle feature to two separate buttons.
